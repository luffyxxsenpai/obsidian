Kernel is a very integral part of our os which sits btw the applications and hardwares. the kernel manages system resources, including the CPU, memory, and I/O devices, ensuring smooth communication and efficient functioning.
 
`uname -a = shows all
`uname -r = show kernel release

Linux kernel modules are dynamically loadable pieces of code that can be added or removed from the Linux kernel at runtime. These modules extend the functionality of the kernel without the need for recompiling or rebooting the system. Essentially, they act like plugins that can be integrated into the kernel when needed and unloaded when no longer required.


```bash
lsmod = shows the currently loaded kernel modules 
Module                  Size  Used by
amdxcp                 12288  1 amdgpu
amd_atl                40960  1
uvcvideo              180224  0
intel_rapl_msr         20480  0
snd_hda_codec_generic   131072  1 snd_hda_codec_realtek
btusb                  86016  0
drm_exec               12288  1 amdgpu
snd_usb_audio         557056  2
ath10k_core           815104  1 ath10k_pci
```

`modinfo modname = give more info about the module` 

`modprobe modname = load the module in kernel
`modprobe -r modname = unload the module from kernel

 KERNEL message buffer contains system log message generated by kernel. these message involves hardware initilization, device drivers, system boot and other kernel operations which can be usefull whilte troubleshooting system or hardware issues. 

`dmesg = shows entire kernel message buffer
`dmesg -w = live logs
`dmesg -Tw = live log with time
